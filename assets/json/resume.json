I would like to recommend Jiazhe Chen to his future supervisors and colleagues. Jiazhe Chen is one of the most outstanding fellow students I have ever seen during my Ph.D. study at The University of Tokyo. We often discussed the course contents regarding economics, econometrics, and data science. He always has a variety of excellent ideas. I was often inspired by him when I conceived my doctoral dissertation on teacher effects in education economics. Moreover, he has achieved a series of excellent grades in many courses during his study as a master's degree student at UTokyo. Not only does he has brilliant insights in terms of lectures on campus, but he also endeavors to master knowledge from online courses. He obtained a MicroMasters credential in statistics and data science from MITx. In addition, I noticed that he participated in data science internships during summer breaks from UTokyo Alumni System. In short, I strongly recommend Jiazhe for any position related to statistics, econometrics, and data science."}],"projects":[{"name":"Quantum Computing","summary":"Quantum computing is the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation.
