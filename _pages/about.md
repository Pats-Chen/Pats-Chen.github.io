I am currently pursuing a master degree in Computer Science at Northeastern University. I have previously earned a Master of Economics from The University of Tokyo. My academic background, coupled with hands-on project work, has equipped me with the skills to develop complex applications. Notable projects include a travel planning web application and a collaborative painting program, both of which highlight my ability to handle back-end architecture and front-end development with equal proficiency.

In my professional experience, I have worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Seelove Technology and a Contract Software Engineer at Kanahato K.K., where I contributed to projects focused on UI/UX design, 3D model integration, and enterprise-level data security. My roles involved optimizing CI/CD pipelines, enhancing user authentication processes, and ensuring efficient data handling across platforms.

As a junior software engineer with a strong foundation in Python, JavaScript, and C++, I have a proven track record in full-stack web and desktop application development. My experience includes designing and implementing scalable projects, where I have consistently delivered reliable software products through effective collaboration and a focus on user-centric solutions. I am eager to continue applying my skills in innovative environments and contribute to the development of impactful software solutions.
